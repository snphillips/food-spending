## Background
I have tracked my spending since 2011 and as a result, have an abundance of data. I'm learning D3.js and have decided to create a bar chart that visualizes five years of food spending.

I have catergorized month spending in the following ways: groceries, coffee out, snack out, breakfast out, lunch out and dinner out.

## Made With
- React.js
- D3.js
